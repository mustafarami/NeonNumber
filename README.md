# NeonNumber
A "Neon Number" is a number where the sum of digits is square of the number is equal to the number itself.

Example:
9 is a neon number.
It's square is 9*9 = 81 and sum of the digits 8+1 = 9. As, 8+1 = 9, which is same as the number entered, so it's a Neon Number.

Note:
Except 1 and 9 there are no more neon numbers between 1 to n.
